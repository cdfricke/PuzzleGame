This is a simple program designed for console output of a search algorithm solving a puzzle game, in which tiles are arranged in a 3x3 matrix with an initially shuffled state.
The program will use a type of search algorithm, perhaps eventually multiple iterations will use different search algorithms
Algorithms are yet to be implements, but may be (updated list):
  A* search
  Greedy Search
  Depth-Limited Search

Within main.cpp, I have begun implementing the necessary structures which I believe will help me in this project.
