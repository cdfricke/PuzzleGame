This is a simple program designed for console output of a search algorithm solving a puzzle game, in which tiles are arranged in a 3x3 matrix with an initially shuffled state.
The program will use a type of search algorithm, perhaps eventually multiple iterations will use different search algorithms.
The goal is to shuffle tiles to reach a goal state. A solution may look like:

  [ 1 2 3 ]\
  [ 8 0 4 ]\
  [ 7 6 5 ]

Algorithms are yet to be implements, but may be:
  A* search
  Greedy Search
  Depth-Limited Search

Within main.cpp, I have begun implementing the necessary structures which I believe will help me in this project.
